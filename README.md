// this is comment line.all lines beginning with two slash sign(//) are considered comment and do not have any effect on the behavior of the program.

 #include <iostream>: line beginning with hash sign (#) are directives for the processor. in this case the directives #include<iostream> tells the processor to include the iostream standard file. this specific file<iostream> includes the declaration of the basic standard input, output libraryin C++ and it is included because its functionality is going to be used later in the program also This includes a library that allows us to use cout (to print messages).

 
 using namespace std; :all the element of the standard C++ libray are declared within what is called a namespace, the namespace with the name std. so in order to access its functionally we declare with this expression that we will be using these entities. This makes writing simpler (otherwise, we’d have to type std::cout).

 
 int main():this line correspond to the beginning of the definition of the main function. the main function is the point by where all C++ programs start their execution. right after the paranthese we can find the body of the main function enclosed in braces {} what is contained within these braces is what the function does when it is.Every C++ program must have a main() function—this is where the program starts.

 
 cout << "Hello, World!"; :this line is C++ statement is a simple or compound expression that can actually produce some effect. in fact this statement perform the onlyaction that generates a visible effect in our first program.This prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.


 return 0 : the return statement cause the main function to finish, return may be followed by return code in our example is followed by the return code 0.This is the most usual way to ends the C++ program successfully.

 
cin >> name; :Takes user input for the variable name. 
cin >> age; :Takes user input for age.
